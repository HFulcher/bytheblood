      <p class="font-body pb-5">
        The name "By The Blood" has two inspirations. Firstly, Ephesians 2:13:
      </p>
      <p
        class="font-brand text-brand-accent2 md:w-1/3 text-center self-center text-sm pb-5"
      >
        "But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought
        near by the blood of Christ."
      </p>
      <p class="font-body pb-5">
        The overall aim of this blog is to bring its readers (and writers) back
        to the centrality of the Gospel. That only through the shedding of
        Christ's blood can we be saved and brought into a right relationship
        with God.
      </p>
      <p class="font-body pb-5">
        The second inspiration comes from John Piper's poem
        <a
          class="underline text-brand-accent1"
          href="https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/the-calvinist"
          >"The Calvinist"</a
        >:

      <p
        class="font-brand text-center text-brand-accent2 md:w-1/3 self-center text-sm pb-5"
      >
        "See him worshipping. <br />
        Watch the sinner sing,<br />
        Spared the burning flood<br />
        Only by the blood."
      </p>
      <p class="font-body pb-10">
        Our lives are to be acts of worship to the merciful God who has saved
        us. The hope is that this blog will be in its own way and act of worship
        that draws our eyes to God rather than downwards to the world.
